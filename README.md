# Game Overview
A 2D Platformer. The player can defeat enemies and collect their information, once enough information is collected, the player transform into the corresponding enemy.

#Core Gameplay Mechanics
Each entity (player and all enemies) can move left and right, (sometimes up and down), jump, normal attack, special attack.
Enemies move according to programmed patterns, e.g. attack the player on sight.
The player has a (hidden) gauge for each enemy species, indicating how much information on that species has been collected.
Once the gauge is full (100%) the species is unlocked for the player.
The player has 4 slots (including the default species at the game start) available to set unlocked enemy species he will be able transform into.
These slots can only be changed at special spots in the map, e.g.: resting places.
Enemy species have passive abilities (like water breathing, flying, wall phasing) that the player will have to make use of after transforming into them.
There are different enemy species rarities, meaning weak enemies appear frequently, strong/convienent enemies seldom.
The amount of information (percentage on the gauge) received after defeating an enemy is random, with rare enemies having a much smaller probability of giving a lot.

In exchange for the simplistic controls/behaviours, there should be a plethora of creatures to defeat and transform into.
